# Deployment Guide

This guide walks you through deploying your AI Sports Analysis Tool to GitHub and setting up a new repository.

## Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

### Clean Up Large Files
Since you originally cloned this from another repository, you'll want to create a fresh start:

```bash
# Remove git history (if you want a fresh start)
rm -rf .git

# Initialize new git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Make initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: AI Sports Analysis Tool"
```

### Check File Sizes
Before committing, ensure no large video files are included:

```bash
# Check for large files
find . -size +50M -type f

# If any large files are found, add them to .gitignore
echo "large_video_file.mp4" >> .gitignore
```

## Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

### Option A: GitHub Web Interface
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "New Repository"
3. Choose a descriptive name (e.g., `ai-sports-analysis`, `sports-ai-tracker`)
4. Add description: "AI-powered sports analysis tool with real-time feedback and statistics overlay"
5. Choose Public or Private
6. **Don't** initialize with README (you already have one)
7. Click "Create repository"

### Option B: GitHub CLI
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
# Then create repository
gh repo create ai-sports-analysis --public --description "AI-powered sports analysis tool"
```

## Step 3: Connect and Push

```bash
# Add your new repository as origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/ai-sports-analysis.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4: Repository Setup

### Add Repository Topics
In your GitHub repository settings, add relevant topics:
- `computer-vision`
- `sports-analysis`
- `opencv`
- `mediapipe`
- `python`
- `ai`
- `pose-detection`

### Enable GitHub Features

#### Issues
- Enable issues for bug reports and feature requests
- Create issue templates (optional)

#### Actions (CI/CD)
Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for automated testing:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, '3.10', '3.11']

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v3
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    - name: Lint with flake8
      run: |
        pip install flake8
        flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
    
    - name: Test imports
      run: python -c "import cv2; import mediapipe; import numpy; print('All imports successful')"
```

## Step 5: Documentation Enhancements

### Create Sample Data
Since video files are too large for GitHub, create sample JSON files:

```bash
# Create samples directory
mkdir samples

# Add sample JSON with anonymized data
cat > samples/sample_analysis.json << 'EOF'
{
  "shots": [
    {
      "timestamp_of_outcome": "0:15",
      "shot_by_player": "Player 1",
      "shot_type": "Forehand Drive",
      "point_winner": "Foreground Team", 
      "current_score": "1-0-1",
      "feedback": "Excellent shot placement! The forehand was executed with perfect timing."
    },
    {
      "timestamp_of_outcome": "0:32",
      "shot_by_player": "Player 2", 
      "shot_type": "Backhand Slice",
      "point_winner": "Far Side Team",
      "current_score": "1-1-2", 
      "feedback": "Great defensive shot with good court coverage."
    }
  ]
}
EOF
```

### Add License
Create a LICENSE file:

```bash
cat > LICENSE << 'EOF'

EOF
```

## Step 6: Release Management

### Create Your First Release
```bash
# Tag your initial version
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial release: AI Sports Analysis Tool"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### Release Notes Template
Create release notes on GitHub with:
- **Features**: Core functionality list
- **Installation**: Quick setup instructions  
- **Usage**: Basic usage examples
- **Requirements**: System requirements
- **Known Issues**: Any limitations

## Step 7: Community Setup

### Add Security Policy
Create `.github/SECURITY.md`:

```markdown
# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please send an email to [your-email@domain.com]. 

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.
```

### Pull Request Template
Create `.github/pull_request_template.md`:

```markdown

```

## Step 8: Promotion and Sharing

### Social Media
- Share on Twitter/X with relevant hashtags
- Post in relevant Reddit communities
- Share in computer vision Discord servers

### Documentation Sites
- Consider creating GitHub Pages for documentation
- Add to awesome lists (awesome-computer-vision, etc.)
