# AI Pickleball Analysis Tool üèì

An AI-powered pickleball analysis tool that overlays scores, shot info, and coaching feedback on top of your pickleball videos using OpenCV + MediaPipe.

## Features

- **Real-time Player Tracking**: Uses MediaPipe pose detection to track player movements
- **Score Tracking**: Automatically updates and displays team scores
- **Shot Analysis**: Displays shot types and player actions with timing
- **Animated Feedback**: Color-coded visual feedback for point outcomes
- **Multiple Video Support**: Configure different video/analysis combinations
- **Professional Overlay**: Clean, broadcast-style graphics overlay

## Tech used:

- **Python**: Runs the program
- **OpenCV**: Reads your video, draws text/shapes, and saves the final MP4
- **MediaPipe**: Detects human pose points so we can find player heads and place overlays
- **NumPy**: Fast number crunching for coordinates and frame math
- **JSON**: Your timeline of shots/feedback that we overlay on the video

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1) Clone your repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-pickleball-analysis.git
cd ai-pickleball-analysis
```

2) Install deps
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run (TL;DR)

1) Put your files next to the script:
- your video: `your_video.mp4`
- your analysis: `your_analysis.json` (see schema below)

2) Open `pickleball.py` and set one config:
```python
CONFIGS = {
    1: {
        'json_file': 'your_analysis.json',
        'video_file': 'your_video.mp4',
        'output_file': 'your_output.mp4'
    }
}
CURRENT_CONFIG = 1
```

3) Run it
```bash
python pickleball.py
```

## JSON Data Format

The magic happens in the JSON analysis file. Here's the required format:

```json
{
  "shots": [
    {
      "timestamp_of_outcome": "0:15",
      "shot_by_player": "Player 1",
      "shot_type": "Forehand Drive",
      "point_winner": "Foreground Team",
      "current_score": "1-0-1",
      "feedback": "Great shot placement! The forehand was executed with perfect timing and placement."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Field Descriptions

- `timestamp_of_outcome`: When the shot outcome occurs (format: "minutes:seconds")
- `shot_by_player`: Name of the player making the shot
- `shot_type`: Type of shot (e.g., "Forehand Drive", "Backhand Slice")
- `point_winner`: "Foreground Team" or "Far Side Team"
- `current_score`: Score in format "team1-team2-serving_team"
- `feedback`: Detailed analysis text to display

```

## Configuration Options

### Video Processing Settings

- `process_every_n_frames`: Controls processing frequency (default: every 3rd frame)
- `animation_duration`: Duration of point outcome animations (default: 1.5 seconds)
- `feedback_display_duration`: How long to show feedback text (default: 5 seconds)

### Display Customization

- Player name and arrow styling
- Score display position and colors
- Text font sizes and positioning
- Animation colors and timing

## Tips

- If the video won‚Äôt open, double-check the file name and location
- For faster processing, use a smaller-resolution video or increase `process_every_n_frames`

## Performance Tips

- **Video Resolution**: Higher resolution videos provide better pose detection but slower processing
- **Processing Rate**: Adjust `process_every_n_frames` based on your hardware
- **Memory Usage**: Large videos are processed in memory - consider streaming for very long videos

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Could not open video file"**
   - Check file path and format
   - Ensure video codec is supported by OpenCV

2. **"Error loading JSON file"**
   - Verify JSON syntax is valid
   - Check file path and permissions

3. **Poor pose detection**
   - Ensure good lighting in video
   - Check that players are clearly visible
   - Consider higher resolution source video

### Performance Issues

- Reduce video resolution for faster processing
- Increase `process_every_n_frames` value
- Ensure sufficient RAM for video processing
